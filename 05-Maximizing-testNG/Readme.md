# Module 05 – Maximizing TestNG Features for Test Automation

This module focuses on advanced TestNG capabilities for organizing and managing test automation suites. It demonstrates how to leverage TestNG groups, parameterization, and XML suite configurations to create flexible, maintainable test structures for comprehensive test coverage.

## Objectives

*   Implement TestNG groups (smoke, regression, positive, negative) for test categorization.
*   Master parameterized testing with multiple data sets via TestNG XML.
*   Create and configure TestNG XML suites for different testing purposes.
*   Separate test logic from test data using parameterization.
*   Build comprehensive regression and smoke test suites.
*   Execute tests by groups and parameters for targeted testing.
*   Manage test dependencies and execution order.
